##Explanation of Washington County 'Year Built' Data

Data in `wash_co_year_built.csv` and `wash_co_rno2tlid.dbf` comes from Roger Livingston of the Washington County GIS Department.  It is derived from their Marshall Swift commercial appraisal software and contains year built values for ~4000 properties (mostly commercial) many of which do not have this attribute in RLIS's tax lot data set.  Within the data the field `MS_IMP_SEG` maps to `RNO` (tax lot account number) in the RLIS data, and `TLNO` maps to `TLID` (tax lot id).  After executing a number of joins between the two aforementioned data sets I've found that if there is a match for either the account number or the tax lot id (the latter of which can be acquired for the csv by joining it to the dbf based on account number) or both, the join is sound.  There are a few cases where the account numbers are different between RLIS and the Washington County data when they are joined based on tax lot id.  However I've inspected these cases and both members of the pair point to the same geometry.  Further, in those cases where the account numbers do not match, no match exists in RLIS for the Washington County account number.
