This repo contains scripts that automate phases of the process of finding taxlots near light rail stops and determining the value of development that has occurred since those stops have been built.  Part of this process is a network analysis from the stop to the taxlots that are within a given walking distance.  This routing is done with ArcGIS's network analsyt (at this time, am looking to migrate this to pg_routing at some point) and files that play a role of the creation of the network which is derived from OSM data and Osmosis are contained in this repo as well.
